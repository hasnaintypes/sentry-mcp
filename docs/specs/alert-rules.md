# Alert inspection and editing

`find_alert_rules` and `get_alert_rule` inspect Alerts through the searchable
catalog (`search_sentry_tools` and `execute_sentry_tool`). `get_alert_options`
discovers configuration choices and `update_alert_rule` edits existing Alerts.
These operations add no direct tools. Reads require `org:read` and `project:read`;
updates also require `alerts:write`.

The `issue` selector reads Sentry Alerts: notification workflows that can be
shared across projects and monitors, cover all projects, or have no connected
sources. Omit `projectSlug` to search the organization, including unattached
Alerts. A project filter selects associated Alerts; it does not make a shared
Alert exclusive to that project.

Lists contain compact summaries and independent pagination for each family.
Use `get_alert_rule(kind='issue', ruleIdOrName='<id>', ...)` for the full detail.
Name lookups reject ambiguous or incomplete searches; numeric IDs with an
explicit kind avoid ambiguity between workflow and legacy metric IDs.

## Detail contract

Issue Alert detail returns structured `alertRule` content:

- Name, enabled state, notification frequency, environment, owner and timestamps.
- Complete trigger and action groups, with all conditions, notification actions
  and component IDs. Provider-native action `config` and `data` are retained;
  unrelated backend metadata is excluded.
- `scope.projectIds` and `scope.includesAllProjects`, identifying the real
  association rather than just the requested project.
- `sources`: connected monitors, their type, project, enabled state,
  configuration, conditions and data sources. Metric query windows are explicitly
  `timeWindowSeconds`. Cron schedules and Uptime checks preserve their own units.

Source IDs support correlating connections. Source 403/404 responses appear as
`unavailable`; authentication failures and server errors propagate normally.
Unknown, missing, or invalid source configuration is explicitly marked unavailable
without discarding other data sources or the Alert detail.
Uptime request headers and bodies are omitted and identified as omitted fields,
consistent with keeping credentials out of inspection responses.

In a project-constrained session, shared Alerts remain readable when associated
with that project. Other projects' source configuration is not exposed:
sources are marked `outside_project_constraint`, and scope includes
`limitedToProject` and, for a concrete project list, `outsideProjectCount`.
The real all-projects flag remains visible without guessing a project count.
Detached or unrelated Alerts are rejected for constrained sessions.

## Options and editing

`get_alert_options` returns one paginated section per call:

- `actions`: action types, installed integrations and services, native config/data
  schemas, and Sentry App settings. `inputGuide` maps internal config field names
  and target enums to the update format.
- `conditions`: available condition types and comparison schemas for the required
  `workflow_trigger` or `action_filter` group.
- `sources`: accessible detectors, including each project's system `issue_stream`.
  Filter by project, type, or monitor query. Each source includes its ID, project,
  enabled state, and connected workflow IDs.

Reuse cursors with the same section and filters. Discovery does not enumerate
every channel, member, or dynamic Sentry App choice; destinations and dynamic
settings may require explicit values. It never invents IDs.

`update_alert_rule` accepts a workflow ID or exact name. Digit-only references
are IDs, with no name fallback. Omitted fields retain their values; explicit null
clears owner or environment. The current enabled state is always sent because
Sentry otherwise defaults it to true during updates.

Triggers replace the trigger group and `actionFilters` replaces all action groups.
Read the complete configuration first, retain component IDs, and edit only the
intended values. All notification providers retain their native config/data.
Slack and Teams accept channel names in `config.targetDisplay` and an integration
ID. A copied old Slack target ID is cleared when its channel or workspace changes;
an explicit new ID is preserved. Other providers use their service, channel,
recipient, or app-specific fields. A saved Slack action with an unresolved channel
returns an explicit error explaining that the Alert was already saved.

Connection changes are additive/subtractive: `addProjectSlugs` and
`removeProjectSlugs` resolve existing `issue_stream` detectors, while
`addDetectorIds` and `removeDetectorIds` address individual monitors. Unmentioned
connections remain intact. Removing a project's issue stream does not disconnect
its other monitors. Already connected detector IDs can be removed even when their
details are unavailable; Sentry still checks removal permissions on the PUT.
Missing or ambiguous issue streams fail before the PUT;
MCP does not create a detector or substitute another type.

Project-constrained writes require the Alert to belong exclusively to that
project before and after the edit. Shared, all-project, and detached Alerts cannot
be edited through such a session. Unrestricted sessions can edit these Alerts
subject to backend permissions. All-project connections additionally require the
Sentry feature and `org:write`; OAuth does not request that scope automatically.
Existing OAuth tokens without `alerts:write` require reconnection.

Successful updates return the saved Alert's configuration and detector IDs.
Use `get_alert_rule` for enriched source details and scope. The backend PUT is
transactional, but the preceding read has no compare-and-swap protection against
concurrent edits. This operation does not create/delete Alerts or edit monitor
detection queries and thresholds.

## Legacy metrics and interpretation

`kind='metric'` continues to use the existing metric alert API until the Metric
Monitor read migration. With `kind='all'`, an HTTP 410 from that API does not
hide valid workflow results: `warnings` explicitly reports that metrics were
unavailable; listing also sets `pagination.metric` to `null`. Other errors
propagate. Empty metric results in this case do not mean no Metric Monitors exist.

Current configuration helps explain which Alerts could match an issue. It does
not prove a notification was delivered historically. In particular, last-triggered
timestamps are not evidence of successful delivery.

The implementation uses workflow detail/list, workflow project scope, and
detector detail endpoints, verified against Sentry's endpoint and serializer
source. Project scope is a private endpoint; missing access fails explicitly.
